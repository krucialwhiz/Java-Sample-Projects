 * The customer purchased three items; find the sum of the three prices to get the total price.
 *  If the total is below $50.00, the customer will receive no discount. 
 * If the total price is over $55.00, he will receive a 10% discount. 
 * If the total price is over $300.00 the customer will receive a 15% discount. 
 * For any other purchase over $310.00, the customer will get a 20% discount.
