/* A car with a 20-gallon gas tank averages 23.5 miles per gallon
* when driven in town and 28.9 miles per gallon when driven on the highway.
* Write a program that calculates and displays the distance the car can travel
*  on one tank of gas when driven in town and when driven on the highway.
*
* Hint: The following formula can be used to calculate the distance:
* Distance = Number of Gallons X Average Miles per Gallon.Ask the user
*
* to enter the number of gallons and then tell the user how long they can drive
* (the distance) for the average car for town and highway driving.
