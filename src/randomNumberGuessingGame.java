/* Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is.
* If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the program should display “Too high, try again.”
* If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the program should display “Too low, try again.”
* The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.
*
* You should also keep a count of the number of guesses that the user makes.
* When the user correctly guesses the random number, the program should display the number of guesses.
