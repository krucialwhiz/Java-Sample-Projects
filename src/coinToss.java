/* Write a function named “CoinToss” that simulates the tossing of a coin.
* When you call the function, it should generate a random number in the range of 1 through 2.
* If the random number is 1, the function should display “heads.”
* If the random number is 2, the function should display “tails.”
* Demonstrate the function in a program that asks the user how many times
* the coin should be tossed and then simulates the tossing of the coin that number of times.
